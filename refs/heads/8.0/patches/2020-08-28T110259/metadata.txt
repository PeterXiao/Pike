Multiple changes:

• Concurrent.AggregateState: Added CAVEAT LECTOR.

• Concurrent.Promise: Improved behavior for CONCURRENT_DEBUG.

Don't store raw backtraces, they may contain references to stuff
that the user doesn't expect to get extra references.

• Concurrent.Future: Added try_get().

• Concurrent.Future: Added query_{success,failure}_callbacks().

• Concurrent.AggregateState: Protect create().
